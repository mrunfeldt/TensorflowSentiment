(2) python tf_lstem.py # command line from folder


##Working sentiment analysis and other small devices using TensorFlow

The module tf_lstm.py performs sentiment analysis as done in Theano's SA tutorial 
(http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html). tf_lstm.py is a modification of
ptb_word_lm.py in TensorFlow's Language Modeling tutorial, reworked to perform SA. Accuracy of 80% is achieved after ~60 epochs.
